We have used React.JS to build this website. 

This project is based on the company ADWorks which is mainly involved in digital marketing and was made for the Google Winter of Code challenge hosted by the GDSC club of our college 

Visit the website on : <link_here>  

Alternatively, you could run it on your computer  

How to run the website on your local computer?   
Once you download all the folders and files, go to the directoy of the project in your terminal 
and type 'npm install' (in case this doesn't work, type 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps')    
Once all the required module files get downloaded, type 'npm start' to run the file on your computer at localhost:3000
